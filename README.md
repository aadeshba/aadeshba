- 👋 Hi, I’m Aadesh Bajaj, a Presidential Scholar at the University of Southern California (class of 2024).
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much everything. I have limited experience so I want to expand my horizons as much as possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, SQL, HTML
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on as many projects as possible. Wherever someone who doesn't have a lot of experience could contribute and still learn.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email- aadeshba@usc.edu

I love sports and playing the guitar and am especially passionate about the intersection of computing with these fields. Please reach out!
